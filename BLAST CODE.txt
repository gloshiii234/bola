The given code is a shell script that performs a sequence database creation and subsequent nucleotide sequence comparison
 using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program. Here's the breakdown of the code:

    makeblastdb -in sequences.fasta -dbtype nucl -out mydatabase

    This command creates a BLAST database from the input file sequences.fasta. The -dbtype nucl flag specifies that the sequences 
in the input file are nucleotide sequences, and the -out mydatabase flag specifies the name of the output database.


    for i in $(ls *fa)

    This line initiates a loop that iterates over each file in the current directory with the .fa extension. The $(ls *fa) command 
lists all files ending with .fa, and for i in assigns each file name to the variable i for each iteration.


    output=$(echo $i | cut -f1 -d".")

    This line extracts the base name of the file without the file extension. It uses the cut command to split the file name ($i) using
 the delimiter (-d".") and extracts the first field (-f1). The resulting name is stored in the variable output.


    blastn -query $i -db mydatabase -outfmt "6 qseqid sseqid pident length evalue bitscore qcovs qlen" -out ${output}_blast.tsv

    This command performs a BLAST search using the blastn program. It compares the sequences in the file specified by the variable $i with the
 database named mydatabase. The -outfmt flag specifies the output format of the BLAST results, which includes the following columns: query sequence ID,
 subject sequence ID, percentage identity, alignment length, E-value, bit score, query coverage per subject, and query sequence length.
 
The -out flag specifies the output file name, which is constructed using the output variable concatenated with _blast.tsv.

Overall, this script creates a BLAST database from sequences.fasta and then performs sequence comparisons using blastn for each file with 
the .fa extension in the current directory. The results of each comparison are stored in separate files with the format filename_blast.tsv.
